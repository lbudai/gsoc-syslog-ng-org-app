# GSoC org. app.

## Why does your org want to participate in Google Summer of Code?
We believe in open source projects, and we know these projects need
developers who will later form developer communities. The syslog-ng application is
a mature and widely-used open source project that we believe is attractive for
students for a number of reasons: Contribution in a number of languages is
possible (for example, C, Python, Java), therefore it is a great platform to learn both the
modern trends and the incredible legacy of the original UNIX conventions. The syslog-
ng application has a friendly, welcoming and growing developer’s community
with users who appreciate features. By attracting students, we think we can
increase the number of developers who will also believe in open source, like we do.
We are highly motivated in becoming good mentors: it is not an easy job, but very rewarding and interesting.
We have a history of participating in GSoC. Students reached out to us to participate this year, too, and we would be glad to do so.

## What would your org consider to be a successful summer?
Our goal is to find new, active contributors to the open source community - not only for syslog-ng. Also, we have some interesting feature ideas and real world problems waiting to be solved.
We would consider this summer successful if students learned enough from our cooperation to be  active in any open source project, even after GSoC 2021 ends.

## How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?
Our mentors passionately love syslog-ng, and would like to share this feeling with others, so motivation is not a problem. To keep ourselves in sync, we will organize a meeting at least twice a month, during which we share the progress and/or difficulties of each one’s projects.

## How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?
We will create the schedule with milestones before we start the working period, and we will sync with the students several times a week. We are planning to create these milestones in a way that there will be considerable progress each week. As a result, the students will see the success regularly, which - we hope - will boost their confidence, momentum and enthusiasm.

## How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC?
We encourage the students to contribute to syslog-ng regularly, via opening PRs, working on issues, and on feature requests. Our students tend to write an introduction email to our mailing list when they are accepted. If there is an open discussion about a part of the code the student is currently working on, we ask for their opinion as well. This year, we also plan to make interviews with the students.

## How will you keep students involved with your community after GSoC?
In case of successfully finished projects, we try to motivate the students to do some improvements (as we believe there is always room for further improvements).
Even if a student fails, we motivate them to finish their tasks, and point out that failing on GSoC only means that they could not finish something in time due to lack of some knowledge.
In our opinion, the real failure is if they stop learning and give up.
